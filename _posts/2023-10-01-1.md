it was an Ok day
I learned more about Jekyll.
fortunately I saw 2 features about it that made it more obvious for me that I could achive what I like and want from it (about feature image in each post and in the home page)
also feature of adding images and iframe easily from youtube and imgur
feature for easily manupulating any css style for layout and stylish look for each section 
I think I can make my own prefered blog look I want ðŸ˜„

also in blender turning of crave and shadow in solid view will make it faster
turn off all simulation stuff by monitor icon

I also managed to do drawing and the gym hooray ! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
