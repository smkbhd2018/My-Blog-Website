Today I Checked All My habits from the app on my phone



but some thoughts enoys me

- ~ I wont be able to do my "foundation of visual art " practice that Master Hosienni gaved me besides practice drawing for the class
	- I draw for an hour a day and it is not possible to do both in this time
	- another things is I told him to give me that "visual art" but now I am not able to do both at same time
		- shit I dont know what to do
- ~ another problem is that it seems I wont be able to do my habits and other stuff in my backlog that I like to do
	- cause it take me more time than I have
	- I want to also practice animating by daily routin and make new characters
		- this was the whole point for this blog post stuff
		- but now it seems I am not able to do this beside other things I do by daily routins
			- I mean I can do it, here and then, But I want it as a daily or n'th time a week habit
	- what are things I am doing daily
		- ~ Going to university (and the transportaion between them)
			- this is IMP (the transportaion)
				- why?
				- cause for "in person class" makes it that you need to get ready for university 1hr
				- 1 hr for going to UNI
				- 1 hr to get back from UNI
				- + the feel of getting tired from UNI and the road
				- it is more than 4hr without the time of classes
				- FUCK IT
		- ~ Classes in Uni
			- 3 hr (around)
		- ~ Drawing practice
			- 1hr
		- ~ Gym
			- 1:30 hr
		- ~ Team Stuff for animation
			- 2 hr daily 
				- sometimes it is 6hr a day
				- sometimes less
		- ~ sleep 
			- 8 to 9 hr
- FUUUUUCK

- ~ some other points
	- stuff that is not your daily routhings and suddenly fucks your timing
		- like shopping for house needs from Bazzar
		- doctor visit
		- e.g. other bullshits

---
- ~ Hypothyroidism
	- I have this condition that makes me feel tired all day than normal person

---
- ~ one other point is tiredness from going out activities
	- any thing like going to somewhere out and getting back has a fatigue effect on me
	- like in person university
	- like Arush classes
	- like friday cloup
	- like going Bazzar
	- going to doctor
	- ...

---
- ~ another new thing added is "university project"
	- I need to complete it in around 3 month
	- I dont know what will happen, what really needed, how much it will takes from me, 
	- I really dont want to do it
	- it is long term (it is not a day work then I say finish!)
	- it has lots of ambiguity
	- FUCCCK

- ~ why does this matter?
	- ~ reasons
		- ~ I need to practice animating
			- why?
				- If I need to go to Animatoin studio for later this road I need to be good at animating,
				- I need to be go at something , I chosed Animating but I dont have time practicing that
				- If my team animation plan dosnt work this will be the alternative road
		- ~ I need to become artist
			- why?
				- all this years I was more in technical side of animation and graphic (and all these bullshits)
				- some people (80%) with this much of knowing software and ability to reproduce some peices or do something not pleasing call themselves "ARTIST"
					- THIS IS BULLSHIT
				- if I really want to get closer this "artist" concept I need to try and error 
					- make and fail
					- by daily bases
					- get a sense of artist eye
						- not just a technical person
							- I have this side enough ( FOR NOW )
	- ~ because of these last two I also need to add a daily (or n'th times a week) routing for making character and animate them + making some replication of what I love from other new and old "artists"


- lets see what will happen
